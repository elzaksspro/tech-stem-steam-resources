Welcome! 

Here is a non-exaustive, work in progress repository of resources for tech, STEM, and STEAM resources. 

I've developed this set of resources for my <a href="http://www.innoarchitech.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_content=repolink&utm_campaign=opensource">_InnoArchiTech_</a> blog writing, and as supporting materials for my engagements involving educating, speaking, and promoting education and careers in tech, STEM, and STEAM industries and roles.

Resources include all files and links in this repository. A hyperlinked <a href="#toc">_table of contents_</a> is provided below for your convenience, and note that links are listed in no particular order of preference or relevance. Well... except for my _blog_ maybe :)
